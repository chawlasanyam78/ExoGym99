          <p>FACT: Most people who get COVID-19 will have a mild form of the illness and will be able to recover at home, without needing hospital treatment. Stay home and call your local health authority for advice if you have any symptoms of COVID-19. If you have difficulty breathing, persistent pain in your chest or loss of speech or mobility, call your health provider straight away.</p>

          <p>Can you always tell if someone has COVID-19?</p>
          <br>
          <p>FACT: No. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be in someone’s body for up to 14 days before they get symptoms, and some people will have such a mild case of COVID-19 that they might not have any symptoms.</p>

          <p>Does COVID-19 only affect old people, meaning young people don’t have to worry?</p>
          <br>
          <p>FACT: While COVID-19 can be more dangerous in older people, anyone can get it including young people, some of whom become seriously ill. While we don’t yet fully understand why some people get more serious symptoms, we do know that young people are more likely to develop serious symptoms if they have certain underlying health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, cancer or high blood pressure.</p>

          <br>
          <p>FACT: You can get COVID-19 no matter how sunny and warm it is. Exposing yourself to the sun or high temperatures does not prevent or treat COVID-19. So, whatever the weather you should follow the official advice to protect yourself from the virus.</p>

          <p>Should I use a strong disinfectant to clean my hands and body to protect myself from COVID-19?</p>
          <br>
          <p>FACT: You shouldn’t use strong disinfectant to clean your body. Washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water or rubbing an alcohol-based sanitizer on them will stop the virus from being passed on. Using stronger chemicals on your skin can be dangerous. Never drink disinfectant or hand sanitizer as this can do serious damage.</p>

          <br>
          <p>FACT: There is no drink, hot or cold, that will protect you from coronavirus or cure the illness. Most people who get COVID-19 recover by themselves. Taking paracetamol, drinking lots of liquids, and getting enough rest can help you manage your symptoms.</p>
